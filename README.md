# Malware Mutation using Deep Reinforcement Learning and GANs 


The purpose of our project is to use artificial intelligence to mutate a malware sample to bypass anti-virus agents while keeping its functionality intact. In the past, notable work has been done in this domain with researchers either looking at reinforcement learning or generative adversarial networks as their weapons of choice to modify the states of a malware executable in order to deceive anti-virus agents. Our solution makes use of a combination of deep reinforcement learning and GANs in order to overcome some of the limitations faced while using these approaches independently.

## Overview


The proposed solution successfully generates a mutated malware sample by using reinforcement learning to decide on the sequence of modifications to make. In case the modifications chosen by the RL agent is either adding import functions or adding/renaming section names, GANs are used to generate an adversarial feature vector of imports and sections that perturb a malware to appear benign in contrast to randomly selecting the imports and sections.

## Installation Instructions

The following steps will guide you through all the installations required to set up the environment.

1. Install and set up Python 3. [Installation Instructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

1. Clone the repository. 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hitb-aichallenge/tAIchi.git
    ```
1. Move into the project directory. 

    ```sh
    cd tAIchi
    ```
    
1. Download malware and benign binary samples from [here](#training-and-testing-data).
 
1. Setting up a virtual environment in Python 3.7. 

   1. Downloading and installing _virtualenv_. 
   
   ```sh
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
   
   2. Create the virtual environment in Python 3.7.
   
   ```sh
    virtualenv -p path\to\your\python.exe test_env
    ```    
    >Note: In Windows, your Python3.7 environment is most likely to be in the following directory: `C:\Python37\Python.exe`.
   
   3. Activate the test environment.     
   
        1. For Windows:
        ```sh
        test_env\Scripts\Activate
        ```        
        
        2. For Unix:
        ```sh
        source test_env/bin/activate
        ```    
   4. Test out the version of your virtualenv environment to confirm it is in Python3.7.     
           
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```    

1. Install all the required libraries, by installing the requirements.txt file.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > Refer to the official PyTorch link in order to download the torch library appropriate for you [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
    > Install lief for Python 3.7 using the following command.
      ```sh
      pip install https://github.com/lief-project/packages/raw/lief-master-latest/pylief-0.9.0.dev.zip
      ```

## Acknowledgments

* The gym-malware environment (https://github.com/endgameinc/gym-malware) was modified to extract only 518 out of 2350 features for the training of the agent i.e. byte histogram normalized to sum to unity and two-dimensional entropy histogram. Additionaly only 4 actions are used for the mutation i.e. append random bytes, append import, append section and remove signature.

* Yanming Lai's ([here])(https://github.com/yanminglai/Malware-GAN) and Zayd Hammoudeh's ([here])(https://github.com/ZaydH/MalwareGAN) work on implementation on Han and Tan's MalGAN played a crucial role in our understanding of the architecture. A mojority of the implementation of the MalGAN used in this project has been forked off Hammoudeh's work.
